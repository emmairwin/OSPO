# Microsoft OSPO
A place where we'll share various resources we've created to help our team and others learn about open source and how to work in an open source way.  Currently this includes learning resources, survey questions, and other resources.  We hope you find these useful and welcome contributions to make them better.

## Content by directory

### Learning Resources

- [Releasing an open source project](learning_resources/releasing-oss/releasing-oss-strategy.md)
- [Teaching open source risk and investment - a framework](learning_resources/using-oss/investment-framework.md)
- [Moderating OSS - pocket guide](learning_resources/moderating-oss/moderating-oss-repos.md)

### Surveys

- [Examples survey questions for OSPOs](surveys/foss-fund/)

### Repository cohorts

The repository cohorts directory holds an example of the repository cohorts concept. 
Some of the content in this directory is associated with a 2024 Open Source Summit talk.
The `framework` directory within the `repository_cohorts directory` holds an Observable Framework project 
that builds a static GitHub pages page that should be viewable [here](https://microsoft.github.io/OSPO/repository_cohorts/framework/dist/)
. It implements the repository cohorts concept for a fixed export of Microsoft public repository metadata.
