# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Worksheet for teams working in open source

A code of conduct guides the standards for behavior in a community, methods and structure for enforcement are well documented.  What is less clear (but can be a big concern) for teams is how to manage day-to-day interactions that might cause tension, fatigue and burnout.  This pocket guide is designed to help teams think through how to manage these interactions and create a plan for how to handle them.

Each section provides a 'prompt' for conversation and brainstorming.  It is important to note that the prompts are not exhaustive and may not be relevant to every team or project.

## :sunglasses: Who are you collaborating with in the open?

Be mindful about who your collaborators are; those you will be intentional about
engaging with, and those who may turn up to participate in some other way
(friendly, or otherwise). As you go through the next sections, give time to
consider the goals, motivations and challenges associated with each.

- [ ] Partners
- [ ] Developers
- [ ] Students
- [ ] Fans/Enthusiasts
- [ ] Influencers
- [ ] Users
- [ ] Customers
- [ ] Support Contributors (helping users)
- [ ] Designers
- [ ] Localizers
- [ ] Regionally-specific collaborators (language/geography)
- [ ] External Maintainers or other Community Leaders
- [ ] Other

**What type of engagement do you think you'll see from these groups?**

- [ ] Contribution (code, design, localization, documentation etc.)
- [ ] Bugs/Issues/Complaints
- [ ] Mentorship/Welcoming people
- [ ] Content Production (social media or otherwise)
- [ ] Leadership (GitHub triage role or other formalized position)
- [ ] Other

**What feelings and moods do you think you'll see (or you have seen)?**

As the pandemic made visible, there is so much more going on behind the scenes
of people's lives than is visible in their online interactions. Your
collaborators may be having one of their best days ever, or experiencing
debilitating lows. In both cases, emotions can unintentionally bleed into
interactions. **Have a discussion with your team about how you might amplify
positive interactions, and diffuse the more challenging**.

> **Remember**: You are representing your project/company/organization in the Open; as such, it's
> critical that interactions are respectful and professional; at all times, and
> on all platforms. Be curious! Its surprising how a situation can be diffused,
> by asking simple follow-up questions, showing empathy and seeking clarity.

Some moods you may run into:

- Enthusiasm
- Frustration
- Excitement
- Anger
- Admiration
- Helpfulness
- Self-doubt
- Fear
- Creativity
- Arrogance
- Happiness
- Exhaustion
- Urgency

If, for any reason, you feel out of your comfort zone, refer to your organizational or team leadership.

## :octocat: What tools are you using for these collaborations?

**Which are company/project/org-owned/managed tools?** Your Code of Conduct applies
to all spaces owned by company/project/org, these include things like GitHub
repository.

- [x] GitHub Issues and Pull Request conversations
- [ ] GitHub Discussions
- [ ] Forums
- [ ] Mailing Lists
- [ ] Blog(s)
- [ ] Chat channels

**Which are owned/governed by external individuals or groups?**

Keep in mind, that unless articulated otherwise, these spaces are governed at
the discretion of the channel/platform owner.

- [ ] Slack
- [ ] Discord
- [ ] Discourse
- [ ] Riot/Matrix
- [ ] Twitter/Threads
- [ ] IRC

> :mega: **You MUST have a plan for each of these should an employee
> report** or experience a violation of that Code of Conduct. For each, document
> for your team, who the accountable channel owners are, where to find the Code
> of Conduct and how to report incidents. If you can not find this information,
> it's strongly recommended that you find alternate spaces for this
> collaboration.

## :thumbsup:What behaviors do you want to ENCOURAGE?

The Open Source Code of Conduct outlines 'Expected Behaviors', but it's
important to lay ground work in the context of your project spaces. You can do
this in the README, or CONTRIBUTING, or make use of issue templates- _the point
being, that by having these documented somewhere, it's easy to point to as
evidence of project expectations_

### Examples

#### Building and Supporting a Healthy Project Community

- [x] Use people's pronouns
- [x] Add alt text to shared images
- [x] Ask questions, seek to understand before challenging or correcting
- [x] Gratitude - a simple thank you goes a long way
- [x] Patience - give time for maintainers to respond to issues, pings and the
      like
- [x] Celebrate each other's success
- [x] Avoid comparison of contribution value, frequency or importance
- [x] Remember that life happens, sometimes people are away for personal
      reasons, and not ignoring you
- [ ] Other - what other behaviors would you add?

#### Follow Processes and Policy

- [x] Adhere to the
- [ ] [Your Open Source Code of Conduct]()
- [ ] Following documented template prompts for reporting an issue or submitting
      a PR on GitHub
- [ ] Look for open issues of the same topic, before opening a new one.
- [ ] Other policy

## :thumbsdown: What behaviors do you want to DISCOURAGE?

Remember, what's unacceptable in a business setting, is also unacceptable in
Open Source collaborations. **This is true no matter someone's role, tenure,
popularity or influence**. By documenting these specifically in the context of
your project, you are setting a bar aligned with your Code of Conduct.

:mega:_It's helpful to be specific, as phrases like 'Don't be a jerk' which are
often left to interpretation of what being a jerk means._

### Examples

#### Disruptive Ways of Working

Many Code of Conduct lists 'disruptive behavior' as a violation, which
creates room for maintainers and community leaders alike, to identify behaviors
that are disruptive in the context of their specific projects. There are some
that, are easy (like no spamming), but others like the repeated re-opening of
issues can seem to be blurry.

:mega: _If behaviors contribute to continued distraction of your team, or which
adds stress to the collaborations in your community, chances are the behavior is
disruptive should be addressed_.

- [x] Avoid use of ALL CAPS as a way of emphasis or yelling
- [x] Don't re-open issues when sufficient attempts have been made to address
      the concern
- [x] No Spamming, advertising or promotion of professional services
- [ ] What other disruptive activities would you want to include?

#### Negative Impact on Community Health

At the top of the many codes of conduct you'll
see 'Our Pledge', which then lists what's often called 'protected groups', or
'supported groups'. These groups are those who have, historically, been
excluded, made invisible or harmed in Open Source communities. This list signals
accountability for the experiences of the most vulnerable and marginalized
groups in communities, and accountability to ourselves. As such, it's important
to be on the lookout for behaviors that may target these groups.

Suggestion: document a moderation plan internally, so that you can be consistent.

For example...

- [x] Don't dead-name people (use people's former names)
- [x] Don't comment on someone's appearance in any way
- [x] Don' English as a first language, avoid jargon and slang
- [x] Negative behaviors in non-project spaces which have negative impact on the
      community, this includes making personal comments on social media
- [x] Don't use racist, sexist or discriminatory words in any interaction.
- [ ] What other behaviors have you seen, which you would like to call out
      specifically?

## :cactus: Consequences and when to use them

Below are some ways a Code of Conduct/or escalation of what-seem-like-minor violations might be addressed, according
to severity.  

### What is your escalation pathway?

For the steps below, your team should have a conversation about accountability, but also document things like has admin-access should you need to ban an account.

### Warnings

Generally, a warning is something given in good faith. You believe someone has
made an error, isn't self-aware, may be having a bad day or is otherwise going
to be receptive to the warning. It's important to differentiate between
behaviors that are disruptive (like re-opening an issue in disagreement), and
those which have an impact (intended or not) on people.

[Here is a sample warning notice](coc-communication-templates/warning.md).

### Temporary Bans/Cooling Off Periods

Like Warnings, there is **a huge leap of faith** on your part that the person
given the decision will be receptive to a second-chance. It can be a good
opportunity if someone is experiencing external stress in their lives to take
time, reflect and return, but this option isn't recommended unless you have this
level of insight. Statistically even with this thoughtful evaluation, temporary
bans have about a 50/50 success rate.

Here is an example of a
[temporary ban notice](./coc-communication-templates/temporary-ban.md), which
includes an on-boarding before return. .

### Full Ban

A full ban is just as it sounds - removal from all participation in all project
spaces. This might occur after a warning was unsuccessful. Or, because an
account was obviously created to spam - or someone is just so clearly showing no
intent to participate professionally, and inclusively.

This is the time to revisit all of the different spaces your project
collaborates on and with.

[Here is a sample ban notice](./coc-communication-templates/ban.md).

### Immediate Ban

If someone looks like a 'drive by' participant in your project or community (
unknown account, with only disruptive, spammy, harmful or
otherwise nuisance interactions), reach out to [your escalation path]() to request their account be banned.

## :hammer: Your Enforcement Plan

Use this as a workspace to detail the steps your team will follow in event
someone displays any of the discouraged behaviors in the Code of Conduct, or as
listed in your CONTRIBUTING.md/README.md

### Decision Making Process

**Who should be consulted? Who will make the final decision if there is a
disagreement?**

It's good to have someone responsible and trusted to sign-off on decisions, when
it makes sense. If you are unsure, or there is a tension or anything which feels
out of scope for your team to manage, it probably is out of scope, and you
should reach out to your manager, or skip level following the same process
identified at the top of this document.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how you might, as a team, document your approach. It's
important to remember, that no incident will be the same, and thus some of these
will need to be tweaked for the situation. Nonetheless it's good to have a plan!

**For all drive-by violations:**
Those violations by accounts we do not know, and who are causing disruption despite warning/correction.

We will...

- Immediately email [escalation pathway]() and request their ban on GitHub.
- Take any other steps to ban the individual from tools immediately.

**For violations described in the Code of Conduct, or explicitly in our project
documentation by a known community member as disruptive we will..**

- Give one warning then ban if they continue.

**For violations where the behavior is clearly seeking to be disruptive and the person isn't known in the community**

We will...

- Ban immediately

**For all minor violations that may involve someone who is of high reputation,
and significant to the project in some way (long time contributor, customer
etc)**

We will...

- Talk to [escalation pathway]()
- Warn directly/privately

**For all major violations that may involve someone who is of high reputation,
and significant to the project in some way (long time contributor, customer
etc)**

We will...

- Talk to [escalation pathway]()
- Issue a temporary or permanent ban

### Action Plan

Set aside some team time to agree on your steps.

### Examples

#### For all warnings

We will...

- Publicly warn the person so, we deem a 1:1 message to make more sense
- Update the reporter (if not on the team) on the actions we took
- Monitor

#### For all temporary bans, or cooling off

We will...

- Have a team conversation to create a checklist for action including review of
  all owned and not-owned spaces where this person collaborates.
- Update the reporter (if not no the team) on the actions we took
- Disable participation on all systems
- Set a date for return
- Schedule a 1:1 chat with the person returning with guidelines for their return
- Monitor

#### Bans

We will...

- have a team conversation to create a checklist for action including review of
  all owned and not-owned spaces where this person collaborates.
- update the reporter (if not no the team) on the actions we took

## Last Words

By now you should have a solid idea of how you and your team want to lead by
example the behaviors Open Source Code of Conduct; how you plan
to share expectations in the context of your project spaces, and tactical steps
for following-through on enforcement.
